# csv-to-html
Some scripts for parsing CSV to HTML that I've been using

## Installation

Using `parse-pc.ts` as an example, in reality you can run any script this way.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Install Typescript if you haven't already.
4. Run either `tsc parse-pc.ts` or `npx tsc parse-pc.ts` based on how you've installed Typescript.
5. Run `node parse-pc.js`. As of the writing of this readme, this logs everything to the console, so you can save output to a file e.g. `node parce-pc.js >> output.html`.
